# WebSocket Playground Demo

This page demonstrates the new WebSocket playground that allows you to test WebSocket connections directly from the documentation.

## Basic WebSocket Connection

Test a simple WebSocket connection:

<WebSocketPlayground
  url="/ws"
  title="Echo WebSocket"
  description="Connect to a WebSocket server and send/receive messages in real-time"
  servers={[
    {
      url: "wss://echo.websocket.org",
      description: "WebSocket Echo Server"
    },
    {
      url: "ws://localhost:8080",
      description: "Local Development Server"
    }
  ]}
/>

## WebSocket with Subprotocols

Test a WebSocket connection with specific subprotocols:

<WebSocketPlayground
  url="/graphql"
  title="GraphQL WebSocket"
  description="Connect to a GraphQL WebSocket server with subscriptions"
  protocols={["graphql-ws", "graphql-transport-ws"]}
  servers={[
    {
      url: "wss://api.example.com",
      description: "GraphQL API Server"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Chat WebSocket

Test a chat WebSocket with authentication headers:

<WebSocketPlayground
  url="/chat"
  title="Chat WebSocket"
  description="Connect to a chat server with authentication"
  headers={{
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here",
    "X-Client-Version": "1.0.0"
  }}
  protocols={["chat", "v1.0"]}
  servers={[
    {
      url: "wss://chat.example.com",
      description: "Chat Server"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Features

The WebSocket playground provides:

- **Real-time Connection Management**: Connect and disconnect from WebSocket servers
- **Connection Status Indicator**: Visual feedback for connection state (connected, connecting, disconnected, error)
- **Message History**: See all sent and received messages with timestamps
- **Custom Headers**: Add headers for the WebSocket handshake (authentication, etc.)
- **Subprotocol Support**: Specify WebSocket subprotocols for specialized connections
- **Text and Binary Messages**: Send both text and binary data
- **Multiple Servers**: Easy switching between different WebSocket endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for connection and message failures

## Usage in Documentation

To add a WebSocket playground to your documentation, use the `WebSocketPlayground` component:

```mdx
<WebSocketPlayground
  url="/ws"
  title="My WebSocket"
  description="Description of what this WebSocket does"
  headers={{
    "Authorization": "Bearer token",
    "X-Custom-Header": "value"
  }}
  protocols={["chat", "v1.0"]}
  servers={[
    {
      url: "wss://api.example.com",
      description: "Production Server"
    },
    {
      url: "ws://localhost:8080",
      description: "Development Server"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## WebSocket vs HTTP

Unlike HTTP requests, WebSocket connections are:

- **Stateful**: The connection remains open for bidirectional communication
- **Real-time**: Messages can be sent and received instantly
- **Event-driven**: Both client and server can initiate message sending
- **Lower overhead**: No need for repeated HTTP handshakes

## Common Use Cases

WebSocket playgrounds are perfect for:

- **Real-time APIs**: Chat applications, live updates, notifications
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Real-time data subscriptions
- **Gaming**: Real-time multiplayer game communication
- **IoT**: Device communication and monitoring
- **Trading**: Real-time market data and order updates
- **Collaborative Tools**: Real-time document editing, shared whiteboards

The playground seamlessly integrates with your existing documentation and provides a comprehensive testing environment for WebSocket-based APIs.

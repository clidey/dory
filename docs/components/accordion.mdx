# Accordion

Accordions hide content until the user expands it — ideal for FAQs, optional details, or long reference sections.

## Basic Usage

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Dory?">
    Dory is a static site generator for technical documentation.
    It turns MDX files and a dory.json config into a fast, beautiful docs site.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Dory?">
    Dory is a static site generator for technical documentation.
    It turns MDX files and a `dory.json` config into a fast, beautiful docs site.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multiple Items

Only one accordion can be open at a time.

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install Dory?">
    Install globally with npm: `npm install -g @clidey/dory`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which languages are supported?">
    Dory supports 20+ languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, and more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy to GitHub Pages?">
    Yes. Run `dory build` and upload the `dist/` directory to your GitHub Pages branch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Dory support dark mode?">
    Yes. Dory follows the user's OS preference automatically.
    You can set custom colors for each mode in `dory.json`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## With Icons

Add a `icon` prop using any Lucide icon name:

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication" icon="lock">
    All API requests require a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
    The default limit is 1000 requests per hour per API key.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="alert-triangle">
    All errors return a consistent JSON body with an error code and message.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication" icon="lock">
    All API requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
    The default limit is 1000 requests per hour per API key. Exceeding this returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Handling" icon="alert-triangle">
    All errors return a consistent JSON body with an `error` code and `message` field.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

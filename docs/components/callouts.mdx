# Callouts

Callouts draw attention to important information. Dory provides five pre-configured callout types plus a generic `Callout` component for custom types.

## Note

Use `<Note>` for supplementary information:

```mdx
<Note>
  This feature requires Node.js 18 or later. Check your version with `node --version`.
</Note>
```

**Output:**

<Note>
  This feature requires Node.js 18 or later. Check your version with `node --version`.
</Note>

## Warning

Use `<Warning>` for critical caveats or destructive actions:

```mdx
<Warning>
  This action is **irreversible**. All data in the selected namespace will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>
```

**Output:**

<Warning>
  This action is **irreversible**. All data in the selected namespace will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

## Info

Use `<Info>` for contextual information:

```mdx
<Info>
  Rate limiting applies to all API endpoints. The default limit is 1000 requests per hour per API key.
</Info>
```

**Output:**

<Info>
  Rate limiting applies to all API endpoints. The default limit is 1000 requests per hour per API key.
</Info>

## Tip

Use `<Tip>` for helpful hints and best practices:

```mdx
<Tip>
  Enable response caching to reduce API calls. Cache keys are scoped to the authenticated user.
</Tip>
```

**Output:**

<Tip>
  Enable response caching to reduce API calls. Cache keys are scoped to the authenticated user.
</Tip>

## Check

Use `<Check>` for success states, confirmations, or completed items:

```mdx
<Check>
  Your API key has been generated and is ready to use. Store it securely — it won't be shown again.
</Check>
```

**Output:**

<Check>
  Your API key has been generated and is ready to use. Store it securely — it won't be shown again.
</Check>

## Custom Callout

Use `<Callout>` with a `type` and `title` for full control:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Breaking Change in v2.0">
  The `authenticate()` method signature has changed. Update your integration before upgrading.
</Callout>
```

**Output:**

<Callout type="warning" title="Breaking Change in v2.0">
  The `authenticate()` method signature has changed. Update your integration before upgrading.
</Callout>

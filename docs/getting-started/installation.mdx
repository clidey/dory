# Installation

## Install the CLI

Install Dory globally to use the `dory` command anywhere:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install -g @clidey/dory
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g @clidey/dory
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add @clidey/dory
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
dory version
# @clidey/dory v0.46.0
```

## CLI Commands

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="dory build" icon="hammer">
    Compiles your MDX files and outputs a static site to the `dist/` directory.

    ```bash
    dory build
    ```

    This reads your `dory.json`, processes all your pages, and produces a fully static site ready to deploy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="dory preview" icon="eye">
    Serves a previously built site locally so you can review it before deploying.

    ```bash
    dory preview
    # Serving dist/ at http://localhost:3000
    ```

    <Warning>
      Run `dory build` before `dory preview`. The preview command serves the built output, not the source files.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="dory version" icon="info">
    Prints the installed version of Dory.

    ```bash
    dory version
    # @clidey/dory v0.46.0
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Project Structure

A Dory project has this structure:

```
my-docs/
├── dory.json          # Site configuration (required)
├── favicon.svg        # Site favicon
├── logo/
│   ├── logo.svg       # Logo for light mode
│   └── logo-dark.svg  # Logo for dark mode (optional)
├── assets/            # Images and other static files
└── introduction.mdx   # Your first page
```

<Note>
  Dory expects `dory.json` and your MDX files in the same directory. When running the CLI, point it to your docs folder if it's not the current directory.
</Note>

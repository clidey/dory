# Theming

Dory uses three brand colors defined in `dory.json` to theme your documentation site. Both light and dark modes are supported.

## Color Configuration

```json
"colors": {
  "primary": "#6366f1",
  "light": "#818cf8",
  "dark": "#4f46e5"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `primary` | Base brand color. Applied to active navigation items, links, and accent elements. |
| `light` | Lighter shade. Used for hover states and accents in light mode. |
| `dark` | Darker shade. Used for hover states and accents in dark mode. |

These three colors control the entire look of your site — active sidebar items, links, buttons, card borders, and more.

## Dark Mode

Dory automatically follows the user's OS/browser dark mode preference. No configuration required — it works out of the box.

The `light` and `dark` color fields let you fine-tune how your brand color appears on light and dark backgrounds respectively.

<Tip>
  For best results: choose a `light` shade that's slightly lighter than `primary`, and a `dark` shade that's slightly darker. This ensures good contrast on both backgrounds.
